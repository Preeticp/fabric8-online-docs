= About Iterations

Iterations are used to organize <<about_work_items,Work Items>> in a certain order for planning or implementation of a development project. This can be used to model Sprints when used with Scrum.

The Planner allows you to map your Work Items to specific Iterations to help plan your work based on your project requirements. It enables you to set time-specific goals by grouping priority Work Items into a single development cycle. It helps you track your progress for each Iteration and compare with past Iterations and associated Work Items.
