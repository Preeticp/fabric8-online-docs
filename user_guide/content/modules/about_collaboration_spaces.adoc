= About Collaboration Spaces

Collaboration Spaces are the equivalent of projects. Each <<about_iterations,Iteration>> and <<about_work_items,Work Item>> must be attached to a Space, and a team of people can be attached to a project (Space) in various roles. By default, a Space contains at least one <<about_areas,Area>> and one Iteration.
