= Selecting an Iteration

After logging in and selecting the appropriate space, click btn:[Plan] to view the Iterations for that space. Existing Iterations are grouped into one of the following categories:

* *Current Iteration* displays as a default for this view. It lists the currently ongoing Iteration, if any, and the work items associated with it.
* *Future Iterations* display a list of Iterations that have not started or ended. You can add multiple Iterations based on start dates to this section and start the appropriate one when required.
* *Past Iterations* displays all ended Iterations. 

Select an Iteration listed in one of these groups to display the included Work Items. See <<associating_work_items_with_an_iteration,Associating Work Items with an Iteration>> for more information.

== Future Iterations

After <<creating_a_new_iteration, creating an Iteration>>, expand *Future Iterations* to view all future Iterations and their Work Items.

Select one of the following options after clicking the options (image:kabob.png[title="More"]) icon for the target Iteration:

* Select *Edit* to change the Iteration's details.
* Select *Start* to begin your Iteration. This moves the Iteration to the *Current Iteration* section. 
+
NOTE: Setting the Start Date of an Iteration to the present or current date does not set it as a *Current Iteration*. You must select *Start* for the Iteration to make it the current Iteration.

* Select *Create child* to create a child Iteration for the target Iteration.

== Current Iteration

An Iteration is only set as the *Current Iteration* after it starts.

The *Current Iteration* displays:

* The start and end dates for the Iteration.
* A tracker to track the Iteration status based on the completion of the Work Items associated with it.

To end an Iteration:

. Click the options (image:kabob.png[title="More"]) icon for the Iteration and select *Close*.
. Click the btn:[Close] button to close the Iteration. The Iteration is moved to *Past Iterations*.

== Past Iterations

*Past Iterations* lists all closed Iterations within the Space. Click the options (image:kabob.png[title="More"]) icon and select *Edit*, *Start*, or *Create Child* to work with the Iterations in the list.
