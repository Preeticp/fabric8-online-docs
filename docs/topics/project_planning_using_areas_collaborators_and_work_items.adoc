= Project planning using areas, collaborators, and work items
:context: area-collab

In {ct} the first thing a user creates is a space. As a creator of a space you automatically become an admin for the space. After you create a space you can plan your project work by:

* Adding areas that focus on work related to specific functionalities or particular types
* Adding collaborators to your space and assigning some of them admin roles
* Creating work items
* Assigning work items to respective areas and collaborators

NOTE: Only the creator of the space and admins in the space can view the settings tab (image:equalizer.png[title="Settings"]) to see the areas and collaborators in the space.
