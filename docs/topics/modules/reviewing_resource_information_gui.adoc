= Reviewing the resource information in OpenShift Online

The memory allowances for each OpenShift pod is 512 Mi. As a result, each application consumes nearly 1 Gb of memory for the `Stage` and `Run` environments.

You can monitor the resources consumed by your application either through the OpenShift Online user interface or through the <<reviewing_resource_information_cli,`oc` command line interface>>.

To check the memory limit in OpenShift Online user interface:

. In a new browser tab, navigate to the OpenShift Online console at https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/

. From the list of projects, click *_username_-run* to see the resources used for the `Run` environment or *_username_-stage* to see the resources for the `Stage` environment.
