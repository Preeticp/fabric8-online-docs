= Reducing Spring Boot project memory usage

Your OpenShift Online account must now share resources with two quickstart projects: the Hello World Vert.x project and the new Spring Boot HTTP project.

To optimize memory for the Spring Boot HTTP quickstart:

. In your Che workspace, expand the `src` > `main` > `fabric8` folders.

+
. Right-click the `fabric8` folder and select `New` > `File`.

. Name the new file `deployment.yaml`.
+

+
. Copy the following file's contents to your new YAML file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].
+
WARNING: Spaces are meaningful in YAML files. Ensure that the correct spacing is copied into your YAML file from the link.
+

. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
