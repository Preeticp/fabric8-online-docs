= About collaborators

_Collaborators_ are members added to a link:user-guide.html#about_spaces[space] to work together as a team on a project. They can be assigned tasks related to the project which are tracked using link:user-guide.html#about_work_items[work items].

As the creator of a space you automatically become an admin for the space. Only the creator and admins in the space can:

* Add collaborators to the space
* View user details
* Remove them from the space
* Assign admin roles to collaborators
