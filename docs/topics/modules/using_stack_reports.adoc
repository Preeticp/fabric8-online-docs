= Using stack report

The stack report provides you with data about your stack and its components and provides recommendations based on its analysis of your stack. It enables you to assess the credibility of your components and enhance your stack.

== Components of stack report
The {osio} analytics report comprises three components:

=== Stack summary
The stack summary provides a synopsis of the analysis report.
It highlights the security issues, usage outliers, and unknown or conflicting licenses in your stack. For more information about these concepts see the link:user_guide.html#glossary[Glossary].

=== Detailed analysis of your stack components
The detailed component analysis provides recommendations for relevant alternate components in case of license outliers (that is, licenses not used in similar stacks) and usage outliers (that is, components not used in similar stacks). It also recommends the appropriate versions for your stack components.

It helps you assess the credibility of your stack components by providing various usage statistics for your components such as:

* Number of {osio} projects using these components
* GitHub statistics such as watchers and usage count
* Other GitHub projects dependent on these components
* Tags associated with the components of your stack

To act on the alternate component recommendations:

. In the *Detailed analysis of your stack components*, select *Alternate Components* from the filter to see the recommended alternate components.

. Click *Create Work Item* adjacent to the recommended alternate component to add the component to your stack. {osio} automatically creates a new work item and displays the following success message:

. Click *View Work Item* to view the auto populated work item in a new browser tab.

=== Additional components recommended by {osio}

{osio} recommends additional components suitable for your stack based on its analysis of similar open source stacks. These components are commonly used by similar stacks and augment your stack.

* Click *Create work item* adjacent to the recommended additional component to add the component to your stack.

You have now learned how to use stack reports to analyze and improve your application stack and track the required changes using work items.
