= Changing the quickstart code

To change your project code and preview the results:

. In your Che workstation view, navigate to: `src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `HttpApplication.java`.
+

+
. Double click the `HttpApplication.java` file to open it and find the following line:
+
[source,java]
----
  static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
----
+
. Change the greeting message and then save your changes.
+
[source,java]
----
  static final String template = "Hello from Che, %s !"
----
+
If you already ran the application earlier as instructed in <<running_your_project_in_the_che_workspace-hello-world>>, your changes are instantly implemented. Maven uses the Vert.X hot deploy feature to automatically update the application when you make a change.
. Return to the browser tab running the application, add a name in the *Name* field, and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application. The displayed message shows the amended text template.

You have now learned how the workspace automatically saves and applies your changes.
