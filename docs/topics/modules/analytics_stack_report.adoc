= Analytics stack report

The {osio} analytics stack report provides comprehensive information regarding your  application stack and its component libraries that helps you make informed choices. {osio} analyzes your stack and recommends alternate and additional components to improve your application.

The stack report is available after the first pipeline build completes. To view the stack report for your quickstart application:

. Return to your space dashboard in the {osio} browser tab. The *Stack Report Recommendations* panel in the dashboard shows a summary of the stack report.

. Click each of the cards to view the following detailed information:
+
* *Security Issues* lists dependencies with known security vulnerabilities and the relevant Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information.
* *Licenses* lists dependencies with license conflicts and unknown licenses and suggests alternate dependencies to resolve the conflicts.
* *Insights* identifies dependencies that do not work well with the stack and recommends alternate dependencies for them. In addition, it recommends companion dependencies to enhance your stack. For this example, the stack report recommends companion dependencies that augment your development stack.
* *Dependency Details* lists all the  dependencies in your stack, flags security, usage, and license issues for them, and suggests replacements for dependencies with issues.

You have now learned how the stack report provides detailed information about your stack and its dependencies, and how it suggests alternate and additional dependencies you can add to your stack to improve your application and make it more secure.

. You have now completed the task, *Use analytics to identify and resolve security and license issues in the application*,  in the *Test Iteration*. Navigate to the *Plan* tab and ensure that you change the state of the work item and its parent feature to *Closed*.

. Also, close the *Test Iteration* using the options (image:kabob.png[title="Options"]) icon next to the iteration as you have now completed all the work items associated with your active iteration.
