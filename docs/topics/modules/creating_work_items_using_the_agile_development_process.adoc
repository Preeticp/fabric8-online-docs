= Creating work items using the Agile development process

Agile is an iterative and incremental software development framework for managing product development.

Use the agile guided hierarchy to create work items of the type, Theme, Epic, Story, Task, Impediment, and Defect, as follows:

.Prerequisites

* <<creating_new_space-user-guide,Create a space>> using *Agile* as your *Development Process*.

.Procedure

. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the *Work Items* for your space.
+
NOTE: The tree view is the default view of the planner, that is, the *Show Tree* check box is selected by default.  The tree view allows you to quickly create work items with parent-child relationship using the quick-add and in-line add options. If you cleared it, ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is selected to see the tree view.
+

. Use the quick-add option to create a high level, planning oriented *Theme*, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, specify an appropriate title for the *Theme* in the *Work Item Title* field.

.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, click btn:[Add and open] to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item.

. You can use the in-line add option to create hierarchical child work items quickly. Create a child *Epic* for the *Theme* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the *+* icon adjacent to the *Theme* for which you want to add a child *Epic*.

The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below it.

.. Add a title to the *Epic* and press kbd:[Enter] to create it.
. Similarly, use the in-line add option to create an execution oriented child *Story* for the *Epic*, and further break down the *Story* into action oriented, more granular *Task* type of work items.

NOTE: You can create child *Impediment* and *Defect* type of work items for the *Theme*, *Epic*, or *Story* type of work items as required.
