= Stopping Existing Workspaces

Before creating a workspace for your project, stop the workspace for your previous project. Each running workspace uses your OpenShift Online resources. We recommend checking for running workspaces for older projects each time before creating a new workspace.

Review the workspaces in your OpenShift Online account as follows:

. In your Space's dashboard, click btn:[Create].
. In the `Codebases` view, click btn:[Open] for the older project's workspace. Allow several minutes for the project to load.
. Stop the current workspace in one of two ways:
.. Click the `Workspace` and select `Stop` from the options.
.. Alternatively, within the target workspace:
... Click *>* next to the `Workspace` menu item on the left side of the workspace.

In the displayed list of all workspaces, a green dot next to the name indicates if a workspace is running.
... For all running workspaces, click the stop icon under `ACTIONS`.

Your old workspace resources are now reclaimed in your OpenShift Online account.
