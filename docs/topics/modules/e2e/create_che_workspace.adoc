Create a new Che workspace for your project:

NOTE: Initially, {osio} displays a message about the Workspaces loading (see screen capture). If this message appears for you, allow several minutes for the loading process to complete.

[WARNING]
====
If a new tab does not appear, your browser is blocking the pop up that opens the new workspace. To resolve this:

. Click the blocked pop up icon in your browser's URL field.
. Select the `Always allow pop-ups from https://openshift.io` option (see screen capture) and click btn:[Done].

When loaded and ready to use, the new Che workspace tab includes your new project's GitHub repository folder in the `Project Explorer` panel.
