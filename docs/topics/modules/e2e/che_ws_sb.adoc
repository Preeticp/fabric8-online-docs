= Using a Workspace for the Spring Boot Project

When your Che workspace loads, edit your project code as follows:

. In your new workspace, click the btn:[Terminal] tab and run the following commands:
+
```cli
cd myspringboot
mvn test
```
+
When the maven test succeeds, the `BUILD SUCCESS` message appears in the terminal view. You can commit and push changes to your GitHub repository after the maven test succeeds.

. In the `Project Explorer` view, double-click the `src` > `main` > `java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `service` folders.
. Double-click the `GreetingController.java` file to view it in the editor.
. Add a line break at line 38, then type *@* and then use kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to view a list of context-sensitive options.
. From the list, select `RequestMapping`.
. Edit the file to include the following code:
+
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/goodbye")
public String goodbye(@RequestParam(value="name", defaultValue="World") String name) {
      return "Goodbye " + name + " " +  new java.util.Date();
}
```
+
The added code appears as follows:
+

+
. Save your changes using kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).

. Click the `run` option (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). This sets up the Spring Boot server. Unlike the Vert.x Quickstart project, the hot deploy option is not available for Spring Boot projects.

. In the `run` terminal, the *mvn build* command runs and downloads the required dependencies. When complete, the `run` view displays the following message:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.

. Append the following string to the preview URL in your browser:
+
```url
/api/goodbye?name=Samwell%20Gamgee
```
+
. If successful, the amended preview URL displays the following:
