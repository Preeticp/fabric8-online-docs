= Using Work Items

Create a Work Item that tracks changing a string in your Quickstart project. Use the `Planner` to create a new Work Item for your Space as follows:

. If you have not enabled `Experimental Features`:
.. Click your name on the top right side of the screen.
.. Click btn:[Profile].
.. Click btn:[Update Profile].
.. In the `Experimental Features` part of the page, read the disclaimer and check the `I agree to the terms above and would like to opt into experimental features` option.
.. Click btn:[Update].

. Click your user name on the top left side of the page.
. Click the name of your new Space from the displayed options to return to that Space's dashboard view.
. At the top of the page, click btn:[Plan] to see the Planner view for your Space.  With experimental features enabled, the Planner view includes a green banner with the following message: `This feature is experimental. You can manage experimental features on your profile page. Got it!`
. Click `Got it!` in the green banner to dismiss the message.
. Click btn:[Create Work Item] at the bottom of the screen. This is the fastest option to create a new Work Item.

. In the `Work Item Description` text box, type *Change the greeting in the quickstart code*.
. Click &#10004; to create the Work Item.
