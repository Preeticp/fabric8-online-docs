= Working With Pipelines

When you create a new Quickstart project, a new build/pipeline execution initiates. In a build pipeline, *Stage* and *Run* are individual OpenShift projects. `Stage` is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and then staged on `Run`.

[NOTE]
====
Your {osio} subscription also provides you with an OpenShift Online Starter subscription. This Starter subscription includes two environments named *Stage* and *Run* to deploy your applications. Initially, applications deploy to *Stage*, which is accessible to stakeholders for review using a public URL. If approved and promoted, the application deploys to *Run*, which is similar to a production environment but is another staging area.

The reason *Run* is not named *Production* is that the OpenShift Online Starter subscription does not support running production applications. https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html[Purchase an OpenShift Online Pro subscription] to include support for running production applications.

{osio} includes a *Stage* and *Run* environment to allow developers to experience the modern workflow of pushing an application to a staging environment before production. *Run* therefore is a pseudo-production environment for educational purposes.

After you create a new Quickstart project, you can see the new project build pipeline running in the Space dashboard:

To view your new Quickstart project pipeline:

. Click btn:[Create].
. Click btn:[Pipelines]. This page displays all running pipelines for your Space.

Your new project build pipeline displays on this page at the `Approve` stage:

For your new Quickstart project, the new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 into *Stage* and then, after user approval, it pushes the changes to *Run*.

[NOTE]
====
If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build:

. Click the icon (image:kabob_white.png[title="Options"]) adjoining the pipeline build.
. From the displayed menu, click btn:[Start Pipeline].
