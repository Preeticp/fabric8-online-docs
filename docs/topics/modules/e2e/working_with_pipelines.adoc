= Working With Pipelines

When you create a new Quickstart project, a new build/pipeline execution initiates. In a build pipeline, *Stage* and *Run* are individual OpenShift projects. `Stage` is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and then staged on `Run`.

To view your new Quickstart project pipeline:

. Click btn:[Create].
. Click btn:[Pipelines]. This page displays all running pipelines for your Space.

For your new Quickstart project, the new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 into *Stage* and then, after user approval, it pushes the changes to *Run*.

Optionally, view the build pipeline's details in OpenShift Online:

. In the `Pipeline` page, click `Build #1` for the build pipeline in progress.
. When redirected, log into your OpenShift Online account.
. In the displayed `Builds` view, click btn:[View Log] to view the Jenkins instance logs.
. When prompted, log into Jenkins with your OpenShift Online account. When logged in, the page displays the logs for your pipeline build.
