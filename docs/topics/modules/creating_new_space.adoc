= Creating a new space

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new space. You can then add users as collaborators for the space and all the work is tracked within the space using work items. Each space must have a unique name.

To start working with a new project, you need to first create a new space.
A space allows you to plan your development work using <<about_work_items,work items>> and <<about_iterations,iterations>>, assign work items to <<about_collaborators,collaborators>> within your team, and create and manage software applications within it.

.Prerequisites
