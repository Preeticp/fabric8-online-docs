= Creating a new space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new space with a unique name. You can then create or import codebases within the space, add collaborators, and plan your work using work items and iterations.

. If this is the first space you are creating with your {osio} account, a message about connecting to GitHub appears. To connect your GitHub account to {osio}:

.. Click btn:[Connect to GitHub].
.. If your browser session is already logged in to a GitHub account, {osio} uses it for the GitHub connection step. If not, you are prompted to add your GitHub credentials to connect the account to {osio}. When the accounts are connected, the {osio} home page view displays.

. Click btn:[Create a space] again.
