= Associating a work item with an iteration

You can associate work items with relevant iterations based on your order of execution.

By default, the name of your workspace is set as the root iteration for a work item.

To associate a work item with a relevant iteration:

. In the *Iteration* field, click the root iteration to see the iterations you can associate the work item with.

. Select an iteration and click *âœ“* to save the change.

This part has been removed from the planner, there would be no kebab menu, but am retaining this in case the iteration dialog box resurfaces  some other way.
To associate a work item with an iteration:

. Click btn:[Plan] to see the Planner for your space.

. Click the icon (image:kabob_white.png[title="Options"]) adjoining the work item.

. From the displayed options, select btn:[Associate with Iteration]. The *Associate with Iteration* dialog box appears and displays which iteration, if any, the work item is associated with.

. From the drop-down list, select an iteration for your work item.

. Click btn:[Reassociate].

The work item is now associated with the selected iteration.
