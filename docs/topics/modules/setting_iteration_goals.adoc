= Setting iteration goals

Use iterations to prioritize work items slated for execution in the development cycle as follows:

. After you <<creating_a_new_iteration,create an iteration>>, associate work items slated for the iteration using the preview of the work item. See <<associating_work_items_with_an_iteration>> for more details.
. In the left pane, select the iteration to display the associated work items.
+
NOTE: Only execution work item types such as *Feature*, *Task* and *Bug* are displayed in the iteration view. You can use the tree view to see the parent *Scenarios* or *Experiences* linked to the work items in the iteration.

. Use the *Add Work Item* pane to <<creating_a_new_work_item,add new work items>> to the iteration.
. Use the options (image:kabob.png[title="Options"]) icon to close the iteration after the completion of the development cycle.
