= Interpreting your Stack Report

The Stack Report comprises three components:

== Stack report: An overall stack analysis
The Stack report scans the total number of components in your stack, and reports those analyzed by {osio} and those unknown to it.

It displays:

Security Alerts:: {osio} examines the Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) for the components of the stack and highlights vulnerabilities, if any.
Usage:: It analyzes your overall stack composition, compares it to other similar stacks and displays the number of components in your stack that are not commonly used in other similar stacks or that rarely go together.
Licenses:: It analyzes the licenses used in your stack, and displays the number of unknown licenses. It also displays the number of license conflicts at the stack level and the conflicting licenses used in the stack on mouse hover.

== Detail analysis of your stack components
The detailed component analysis lists all the components in the stack, analyzes them on the basis of various parameters, and recommends relevant Alternate Components.

It helps you assess the credibility of your stack components by displaying component level details such as:

Versions:: It lists Current, Recommended, and the Latest available version of the components in your stack so that you can select a suitable version for your stack.

Security Issue:: Based on the CVEs of the stack components, {osio} identifies security vulnerabilities in your stack components. On mouse hover, it displays the CVE scores of components identified with security vulnerabilities.

License:: It lists Licenses for each component, flags Unknown and Conflicting licenses, and recommends *Alternate Components* in case of *License Outliers*.

OSIO Usage:: It tracks the number of projects in {osio} that use the same component. It recommends *Alternate Components* in case of *Usage Outliers*.

GitHub Statistics:: {osio} tracks GitHub statistics such as Usage and number of Watchers for the components of your stack.

GitHub Dependents:: It lists all the projects dependent on this component.

Categories:: It lists the tags associated with the components of your stack.

You can filter the detailed component analysis report to highlight:

* *<<glossary.adoc#License conflict, License conflict in a Component>>* (image:license_conflicts.png[title="License Conflicts"])

== Additional components recommended by {osio}
{osio} recommends additional components suitable for your stack based on its analysis of similar open source stacks. These components are commonly used by other similar stacks and augment your stack. It also displays various parameters relevant to the components so that you can assess their credibility and make informed choices on adding them to your stack.
