= Interpreting your Stack Report

The {osio} analytics report comprises three components:

* <<Stack summary>>
* <<Detailed analysis of your stack components>>
* <<Additional components recommended by {osio}>>

== Stack summary
The Stack summary provides a synopsis of the analysis report.

It displays:

Security Issues:: {osio} analytics examines Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) of the components in the stack and highlights vulnerabilities, if any.

Usage Outliers:: {osio} analytics analyzes your overall stack composition, compares it to other similar stacks, and displays the number of components in your stack that are not commonly used in similar stacks or that rarely go together.

Licenses:: {osio} analytics analyzes the licenses used in your stack, and displays the number of unknown licenses. It also displays the number of license conflicts in your stack.

== Detailed analysis of your stack components
The detailed component analysis helps you assess the credibility of your stack components.

It provides recommendations for relevant alternate components by analyzing all the components in the stack and their parameters such as:

Versions:: The detailed analysis report lists current, recommended, and latest available versions of the components in your stack, so that you can select a suitable version for your stack.

Security Issue:: Based on the CVEs of the stack components, {osio} Analytics identifies security vulnerabilities in your stack components. The CVE scores are displayed when you move the mouse pointer over components identified with security vulnerabilities.

License:: The detailed analysis report lists licenses for each component, flags unknown and conflicting licenses, and recommends *Alternate Components* in case of *License Outliers*.

OSIO Usage:: The detailed analysis report tracks the number of projects in {osio} that use the same component. It recommends *Alternate Components* in case of *Usage Outliers*.

GitHub Statistics:: {osio} analytics tracks GitHub statistics, such as *Usage Count* and number of *Watchers* for the components of your stack.

GitHub Dependents:: The detailed analysis report  lists all the projects dependent on this component.

Tags:: The detailed analysis report lists the tags associated with the components of your stack.

* *<<glossary.adoc#License conflict, License conflict in a Component>>* (image:license_conflicts.png[title="License Conflicts"])

== Additional components recommended by {osio}
{osio} recommends additional components suitable for your stack based on its analysis of similar open source stacks. These components are commonly used by similar stacks and augment your stack. It also displays various parameters relevant to the components, so that you can assess their credibility and make informed choices on adding them to your stack.
