= Clearing Failed Builds

If you view all your spaces and delete them manually, often this does not clear the build information in the {osio} dashboard view. The failed builds appear as follows:

This is a known issue because when a space is deleted, these builds must also be cleared from the dashboard.

To clear the dashboard:

. Click your name at the top right of the dashboard and then select the *Profile* option from the drop down menu.

. In the profile page, click *Edit Profile*.

+
. In the edit profile page, click *Reset Environment*.

This resets your {osio} environment and clears the dashboard.
