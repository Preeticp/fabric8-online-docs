The *Backlog* displays a list view used to plan your work. You can order work items based on their priority, status, and other parameters to organize them.

The *Backlog* displays the list of work items as a list where all the work items display in a single file.

The btn:[Board] view displays a visual representation of your work item progress. Based on their status, the work items are sorted into the _new_, _open_, _in progress_, _resolved_, or _closed_ columns.
