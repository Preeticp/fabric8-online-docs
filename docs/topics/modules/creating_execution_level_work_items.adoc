== Creating Execution level work items

The Execution team along with the Product owner selects some of the work items such as Scenarios, Features, or tasks to be implemented within the time frame of an Iteration and assigns them to the team members.

You can create work items for an Iteration or select existing work items and <<associating_work_items_with_an_iteration,associate them to an iteration>>.
