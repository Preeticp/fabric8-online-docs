= Reviewing your staged application

When you create a new codebase, the selected pipeline builds your application. It pushes version 1.0.1 of your new application into the _Stage_ environment, and then awaits your approval to deploy into the _Run_ environment.

<<about_pipelines_stage_run,_Stage_ and _Run_>> are individual OpenShift projects. _Stage_ is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and then staged on _Run_.

To review your application on _Stage_:

. At the top of the page, click *Create*, and then click *Pipelines* to see the build pipelines for your new application. The pipeline first sets your build server, starts the build, and releases the build. When the pipeline build pushes the application to stage, it displays at the *Approve* stage. This could take a few minutes.

NOTE: If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build using the instructions at <<pipeline_build_failure>>.

. Click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Stage* in the displayed pipeline. OpenShift Online provides this public URL to access the staged quickstart application.
+
A new browser tab displays the HTTP Booster application running on _Stage_. The Vert.x HTTP booster quickstart produces a simple API behind a REST endpoint over HTTP with a minimalist user interface.

NOTE: If the application does not load, see <<application_not_available>> for troubleshooting information.

. To test the application, enter a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke]. The *Result* field displays the JSON result returning from the API.
