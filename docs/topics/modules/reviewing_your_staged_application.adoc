= Reviewing your staged application

When you create a new codebase, the selected pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 of your new application into the _Stage_ environment, and then awaits your approval to deploy into the _Run_ environment.

link:getting-started-guide.html#about_pipelines_stage_run[Stage and Run] are individual OpenShift projects. _Stage_ is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and then staged on _Run_.

To review your application on _Stage_:

. If you are not already in the *Pipelines* page, at the top of the page, click *Create*, and then click *Pipelines* to see the build pipelines for your new application. When you create a new codebase, the selected pipeline is triggered. In the *Build Release* stage of the pipeline, the build server is set, the build is started, and then released. Next, the pipeline build pushes the application to stage and it displays at the *Approve* stage. This process takes a few minutes.

NOTE: If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build using the instructions at link:getting-started-guide.html#pipeline_build_failure[pipeline_build_failure].

. Click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Stage* in the displayed pipeline. OpenShift Online provides a public URL to access the staged quickstart application.

A new browser tab displays the HTTP Booster application running on _Stage_. The Vert.x HTTP booster quickstart produces a simple API behind a REST endpoint over HTTP with a minimalist user interface.

NOTE: If the application does not load, see link:getting-started-guide.html#application_not_available[application_not_available] for troubleshooting information.

. To test the application, enter a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke]. The *Result* field displays the JSON result returning from the API.
