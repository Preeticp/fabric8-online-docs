= Staging the application

When you create a new codebase, a new build executes. The new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 of your new application into _Stage_ and then, after user approval, to _Run_. In a build pipeline, _Stage_ and _Run_ are individual OpenShift projects. _Stage_ is a production staging area to review and test your application before you approve and promote it to the _Run_ environment. The _Run_ environment is similar to a production environment.

. Click *Create* and then click *Pipeline* to see the build pipelines for your new application. Initially, the build status is *No stages have started*.
When the pipeline build is ready, it displays your application in the stage environment and waits at the *Approve* stage for your input.

If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build using the instructions at <<pipeline_build_failure>>.

. Click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Stage* in the displayed pipeline to review your staged application. OpenShift Online provides this public URL to access the staged quickstart application in a new browser tab.

Optionally, click *Build #1* for the build pipeline in progress to view the build pipeline details in OpenShift Online.
