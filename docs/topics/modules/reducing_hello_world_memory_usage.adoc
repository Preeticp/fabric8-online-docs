= Reducing the Hello World project memory usage

Optimizing memory usage is important when using the Free Tier of OpenShift Online because this tier provides limited memory. Also, each additional project in {osio} requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources.

You can optimize your new quickstart to use less memory as follows:

. In the Che workspace, expand the `src` &#62; `main` &#62; `fabric8` folders for your project.

. Right-click the `fabric8` folder icon and select *New* &#62; *File*.

+

. Name the new file *deployment.yml* and click btn:[OK]. The new file displays in the editor.

. Copy the contents of the following file to your new YAML file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].
+
IMPORTANT: Spaces are meaningful in YAML files. Ensure that the correct spacing is copied into your YAML file from the link.
+

. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
