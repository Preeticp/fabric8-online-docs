= Planning your development work

When you create a space, the *Create an Application* wizard is displayed. Close the wizard, so that you can plan an end to end development workflow for launching and deploying a sample application before you launch the application.

{osio} planner provides a set of predefined templates based on common development methodologies such as Agile and Scenario Driven Development. The development process you select while creating the space determines the planner's guided work item type hierarchy.

This example walks you through the Scenario Driven Development planning process to plan your work.

. In the dashboard of your space, select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the default *Backlog* view of the planner.
. Select the *Show Tree* check box to see the work items and their children in a tree view. The tree view allows you to quickly add work items according to the guided hierarchy using the quick-add and in-line add options.
. Use the quick-add option to create a *Scenario* as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, select *Scenario* from the drop-down list.

+
.. In the *Work Item Title* field, add *Enable an end to end, developer work-flow, using the continuous integration and deployment framework* as the title.
.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the scenario.

. Create a child *Experience* for the *Scenario* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the scenario to see the in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane below it.
+

+

.. Select *Experience* from the drop-down list, add the title *User should be able to launch applications through a simple work-flow*, and Press kbd:[Enter].

. Create an execution oriented child *Feature* for the *Experience* using the in-line add option with the title *User should be able to easily launch a sample Vert.x application using a smooth developer work-flow*.

. Create the following child *Task* work items to implement the *Feature* using the in-line add option:

* <<creating_new_project-hello-world,*Launch a sample quickstart application*>>
* <<approving_build_pipeline,*Test the application in Stage and approve to the Run environment*>>
* <<creating_che_workspace-hello-world,*Modify the quickstart codebase*>>
* <<reviewing_publishing_changes-hello-world,*Review and publish changes to your codebase*>>
+

. Similarly, select *Fundamental* in the *Add Work Item* pane, to create a fundamental work item with the title *The application should be secure with appropriate licenses* and use the in-line add option to create a child experience, feature, and task for it. The task can be titled <<analytics_stack_report,*Use analytics to identify and resolve security and license issues in the application*>>.

+
. In the left panel, click the (+) icon adjacent to *Iterations* to link:user-guide.html#creating_a_new_iteration[create an iteration] called *Test Iteration* and force activate it.
. Click on each of the feature and child task work items to preview it, and:

* link:user-guide.html#tracking_state_of_a_work_item[Change the state of the work items] to *In Progress* when you start working on them
*  link:user-guide.html#assigning_the_work_item[Add yourself as the assignee]
* link:user-guide.html#associating_work_items_with_an_iteration-user-guide_iterations[Associate the work items to the *Test Iteration*]
+
See link:user-guide.html#working_with_work_items[working with work items] for detailed information about modifying and tracking work items by associating them to iterative development cycles.

You can now click *Test Iteration* to see the work items associated with it and use the planner to track your development work for the iteration.
