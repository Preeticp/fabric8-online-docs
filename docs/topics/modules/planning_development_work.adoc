= Planning your development work

After creating a space, use the {osio} planner to plan your development work and to ensure efficient execution of your project.

NOTE: The development process you select, while creating the space, determines the planner's guided work item type hierarchy.

This example walks you through the Scenario Driven Development planning process to plan an end to end development flow of launching and deploying a sample application.

. In the dashboard of your space, select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the *Scenarios* work item type group for your space.
. Select the *Show Tree* check box to see the work items in a tree view. The tree view allows you to quickly add work items according to the guided hierarchy using the quick-add and in-line add options.
. Use the quick-add option to create a *Scenario* as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, select *Scenario* from the drop-down list.
.. In the *Work Item Title* field, add `Enable an end to end, quick, developer work-flow, within a continuous integration and deployment model` as the title.
.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the scenario.

+

. Similarly, select *Fundamental* in the *Add Work Item* pane, to create a fundamental work item with the title `The application should be secure with appropriate licenses`.
+

+

. Create child *Experience* and *Value Proposition* for the *Scenario* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the scenario to see the in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane below it.
+

+

.. Select *Experience* from the drop-down list, add the title `User should be able to launch any application through a simple work-flow`, and Press kbd:[Enter].
.. Similarly, select *Value Proposition* and add the title `Easy end to end developer experience`.
+

+
NOTE: A Scenario can have multiple realizing experiences and supporting value-propositions.
+

. Create a child *Feature* to actualize the *Experience* using the in-line add option with the title `User should be able to easily launch a sample vertx application using a smooth developer work-flow`.
+

. Create the following child *Task* work items to implement the *Feature* using the in-line add option:
+
* <<creating_new_project-hello-world,`Launch a sample quickstart application`>>
* <<approving_build_pipeline,`Test the application in Stage and approve to the Run environment`>>
* <<creating_che_workspace-hello-world,`Modify the quickstart codebase`>>
* <<reviewing_publishing_changes-hello-world,`Review and publish changes to your codebase`>>

+
Click the above tasks to see instructions on executing these tasks.

. Similarly, create a child Experience, Feature, and Task for the *Fundamental* - `The application should be secure with appropriate licenses`. The task could be titled <<accessing_stack_reports,`Use analytics to identify and resolve security and license issues in the application`>>.

For each of these tasks ensure that you use the preview to:

* link:user-guide.html#assigning_the_work_item[Assign the tasks to the collaborators] in your team.
* link:user-guide.html#tracking_state_of_a_work_item[Change the state of the work items] from *New* to *In Progress* when you start working on them and mark it *Closed* once work is completed.

+
For more information, see link:user-guide.html#working_with_work_items[working with work items] in planner.

. Click the (+) icon adjacent to *Iterations* to link:user-guide.html#creating_a_new_iteration[create an iteration] and make it active.

You can link:user-guide.html#associating_work_items_with_an_iteration[associate the features and child tasks to the iteration] to track them and close them within this iteration.

You have now learned how to use the Scenario Driven Development planning methodology to plan your work and create work items to track them.
