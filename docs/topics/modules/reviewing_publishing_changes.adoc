= Reviewing and publishing your changes

When you commit and push a change to GitHub, a pipeline build is automatically triggered in {ct}.

// for user-guide
ifeval::["{context}" == "user-guide"]
.Prerequisites

* Add a new or existing codebase to {ct}.
* Create a Che workspace for your target codebase.
* Make the required changes to your code and then run and test the code by clicking the *run* option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]).
* Commit your changes to your Git repository.

.Procedure

To review the build and publish your changes:

. Return to the {ct} browser tab.
. Click *Analyze* to see your space dashboard. The *Applications* widget displays the details of your deployed applications in the *Stage* and *Run* environments.
. In the *Stage* section of the *Applications* widget, click the options icon (image:kabob_white.png[title="Options icon"]) next to the deployed application to view your application in the stage environment and test it.

// for spring-boot
//ifeval::["{context}" == "create-sb-app"]
//The image below shows the first build, we need an image when build is triggered be cause of commit via che, I did not see a new build starting nor the commit going through, once this is resolved we need to add this image.

image::{context}_versions_applications.png[Versions of the Application]
+
** Different versions of your application are now deployed to *Stage* and *Run*. Version *1.0.2* of the application, which includes your committed change to the code, is deployed to *Stage* because you have not yet promoted it to *Run*. The older version, *1.0.1* , is deployed to *Run* because you approved it the last time the pipeline build executed.
** The green check marks indicate that both builds are operational.
** The *1 pod* indicates that each of the application builds scale to one pod in OpenShift Online. The number of pods indicates the number of running instances of the application.
** The version numbers link to individual running applications. You can use these separate staging areas to share different versions of your application before promoting a change. Click the version numbers to view the details for that deployment.

. Click *Pipelines* to return to the pipelines view and

. After you are satisfied with your changes, click btn:[Promote] to promote the next version of the application to *Run*.
