= Reviewing and publishing your changes

When you commit and push a change to GitHub, a pipeline build is automatically triggered in {ct}.

// for user-guide
ifeval::["{context}" == "user-guide"]
.Prerequisites

* Add a new or existing codebase to {ct}.
* Create a Che workspace for your target codebase.
* Make the required changes to your code and then run and test the code by clicking the *run* option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]).
* Commit your changes to your Git repository.

.Procedure
endif::[]

To review the build and publish your changes:

. Return to the {ct} browser tab.
. Click *Create* and then *Pipelines* to view the build pipelines. Wait for the build pipeline to progress to the *Approve* stage.
. In the *Create* tab, click *Deployments* to see the following information:
+
image::{context}_versions_applications.png[Versions of the Application]
+
** Different versions of your application are now deployed to *Stage* and *Run*. Version *1.0.2* of the application, which includes your committed change to the code, is deployed to *Stage* because you have not yet promoted it to *Run*. The older version, *1.0.1* , is deployed to *Run* because you approved it the last time the pipeline build executed.
** The green check marks indicate that both builds are operational.
** The *1 pod* indicates that each of the application builds scale to one pod in OpenShift Online. The number of pods indicates the number of running instances of the application.
** The version numbers link to individual running applications. You can use these separate staging areas to share different versions of your application before promoting a change. Click the version numbers to view the details for that deployment.

. Click *Pipelines* to return to the pipelines view and click btn:[Input Required] at the *Approve* stage of the pipeline.

. Click btn:[Promote] to promote version 1.0.2 of the application to *Run*.
+
Your changes are now available on both *Stage* and *Run*. If you return to the *Deployments* tab, you can see that version 1.0.2 is deployed to both *Stage* and *Run*.
