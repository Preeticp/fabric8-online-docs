= Using the Scrum guided hierarchy

Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development.

NOTE: The *Development Process* you select while creating your space determines the guided work item type hierarchy, the available work item types, and the available states of the work item in planner.

Use the scrum guided hierarchy to create work items as follows:

.Prerequisites

* <<creating_new_space-user-guide,Create a space>> using *Scrum* as your *Development Process*.

.Procedure

. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the top level work item type group, that is *Epics*, for your space.
. Select the *Show Tree* check box to see the work items in a tree view. The tree view allows you to quickly add work items according to the guided hierarchy using the quick-add and in-line add options.
. Based on the vision statement for the product, use the quick-add option to create a high level, planning oriented *Epic*, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, specify an appropriate title for the *Epic* in the *Work Item Title* field.

.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item, click btn:[Add and open].

. Create a child *Feature* for the *Epic* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the *Epic* for which you want to add a child *Feature*. The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below it.
+

.. Add a title to the *Feature* and press kbd:[Enter] to create the feature.
. Similarly, for the *Feature*, use the in-line add option to create execution oriented child *Product Backlog Item* or *Bug* type work items.

. Use the in-line add option again to further break down the *Product Backlog Item* into action oriented, more granular *Product Backlog Item* type or  *Task* type of work items.

All the execution oriented, *Product Backlog Item*, *Task*, and *Bug* work item types are tracked under the *Backlog items* work item type group.
