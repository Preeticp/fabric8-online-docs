= Creating a new pipeline

To create a new pipeline for your space, you must add a new project to the space. {osio} includes templates to add new projects to your space.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have created a space to use for the pipeline. See <<creating_a_new_space>> for instructions.

.Procedure

. Click the name of a space to view the dashboard.

. Click btn:[Add to space]. The `How would you like to get started?` menu appears for your new space.

. Click btn:[Create a new Quickstart project].
. In the first step of the `Application Wizard`:
.. Select a Technology Stack from the listed tiles.
.. Click btn:[Next].
.. From the options in the `Organisation` field, select an organization. For this example, use the organization name assigned to your personal GitHub account.
.. In the `OpenShift Project Name` field, add a unique name for your project.
.. Leave the default value for the `Group Id` and `Version` fields and click btn:[Next].

. Select a build pipeline strategy. For this example, use the default value (`Release, Stage, Approve and Promote`) and click btn:[Next].

. The `Build configuration` screen displays the details for your `Jenkins space` and options for web hooks and triggering builds. Use the default options for these fields and click btn:[Finish].

You have now added a Quickstart project to your space, which initiates a build pipeline for your new project. At this stage, {osio} also adds your project pipeline into your OpenShift Online account and creates a new GitHub repository for your project.

A confirmation screen appears, which includes a `Git repositories` link. Use this link to view your new project GitHub repository.
