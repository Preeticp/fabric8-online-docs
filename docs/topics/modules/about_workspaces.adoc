= About workspaces

{ct} provides hosted instances of Eclipse Che within your browser to edit, test, and debug your project code. One of the key features of Eclipse Che is Che _workspaces_, which provide a fully configured runtime environment for running your code. As a result, {ct} provides a lightweight, next generation IDE, and a containerized development and testing environment.

When you use the quickstart to create an application in {ct}, the development and testing environment in the workspace is automatically configured with the necessary runtime components. Now you can use the Che workspaces as your personal development machine to modify your application codebase.
