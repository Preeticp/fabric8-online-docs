= Forking an example repository

In addition to creating applications using quickstarts, you can import an existing project into {osio}.


.Prerequisites

Reset your {osio} environment by following instructions in <<resetting_your_osio_account>>.

.Procedure

* You can fork any one of the sample repositories in GitHub. For this tutorial, fork and use the `vertx-eventbus` repository.

Sample repositories available in Github:

* link:https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus[https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus]
* link:https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-paint[https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-paint]
* link:https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-wiki2[https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-wiki2]

If needed, you can import multiple projects into {osio} simultaneously, but this can result in a 12-15 minute delay. Import one project at a time to avoid delays.

NOTE: The OpenShift Online Free Tier provides two pods, and each project requires one pod.
