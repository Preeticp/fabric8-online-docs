= Using the guided work item type hierarchy to create work items

The planner provides two predefined templates, *Agile* and *Scenario Driven Development*, to help plan your development work according to established development processes. The templates prescribe a guided hierarchy of work items using relevant work item types.

The *Development Process* you select while creating your space determines the template, the guided work item type hierarchy, and the available work item types in planner.
