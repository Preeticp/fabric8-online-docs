= About Stack Reports

{osio} analyzes the health of your entire stack and its dependencies and provides insights to help you use appropriate dependencies for your stack in the form of a stack report. The stack report enables you to make informed decisions on the choice of open source dependencies, augment your development stack, and reduce the risk to your organization.

The {osio} analytics stack report provides you information about:

* Security issues in your stack
* License conflicts
* Dependencies comprising your stack

Based on the analyses, it provides insights on:

* Alternate dependencies to replace existing dependencies in case of usage and license outliers.
* Additional dependencies that enhance your stack based on comparison with similar stacks.

Based on these insights, you can create work items and <<modifying_a_work_item,follow through in the planner>> to update your stack as required.
