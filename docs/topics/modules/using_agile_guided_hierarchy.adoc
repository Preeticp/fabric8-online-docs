= Using the Agile guided hierarchy

Agile is an iterative and incremental software development framework for managing product development.

NOTE: The *Development Process* you select while creating your space determines the guided work item type hierarchy, the available work item types, and the available states of the work item in planner.

Use the agile guided hierarchy to create work items as follows:

.Prerequisites

* <<creating_new_space-user-guide,Create a space>> using *Agile* as your *Development Process*.

.Procedure

. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the *Work Items* for your space.
+
NOTE: Ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is selected so that you can see the work items in a tree view. The tree view allows you to quickly add work items according to the guided hierarchy using the quick-add and in-line add options.
+

. Based on the vision statement for the product, use the quick-add option to create a high level, planning oriented *Theme*, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, specify an appropriate title for the *Theme* in the *Work Item Title* field.

.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item, click btn:[Add and open].

. Create a child *Epic* for the *Theme* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the *Theme* for which you want to add a child *Epic*.

The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below it.

.. Add a title to the *Epic* and press kbd:[Enter] to create it.
. Similarly, for the *Epic*, use the in-line add option to create an execution oriented child *Story*.

. Now, use the in-line add option again to further break down the *Story* into action oriented, more granular *Task* type of work items.

NOTE: You can also create *Impediment* and *Defect* type of work items for the *Theme*, *Epic*, or *Story* type of work items.
