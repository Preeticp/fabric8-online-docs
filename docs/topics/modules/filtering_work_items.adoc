= Filtering work items

You can filter your work item list and save them for future reference as follows:

. Click *Plan* to see a list of your work items for the space.
. Click the *Select* drop-down list to see the filter criteria and select one of the filters. You can filter work items by *Assignee*, *Creator*, *Area*, *Workitem type*, *State*, *Label* and *Title*. The drop-down next to the *Select* drop-down auto-populates options based on the selected filter criteria.

. Click the *Filter by _selected filter criteria_* drop-down to see a list of valid options for the selected filter criteria.
+
For example, in the *Select* drop-down list, if you select *State* as your filter criteria, the *Filter by state* drop-down displays all the possible states by which you can filter the work item such as, *New*, *Open*, *In Progress*, *Resolved*, *Closed*, *Deferred*, *No Plan to Implement*.

. Select the appropriate option to filter the work items and see the filtered list.

. Similarly, add multiple filters successively to further refine your work item list. The applied filters are displayed at the top of the filtered work item list.
For example, you can see all the open tasks in your space by adding the *state: open* and the *workitemtype: Task* filters successively.

. If you are not satisfied with the filters, click *x* next to the filter criteria to clear that filter, or use the *Clear all filters* to clear all the filters applied to the work item list.

. After you are satisfied with the applied filters, for future use, click *Save* and add a name to the filter to save the filter under *My Filters* in the left pane.
In the above example, save the multiple filters you added as `Open Tasks` to track all your open tasks in the future.
. You can modify an existing filter as follows:
.. Select the filter on the left pane to see the filtered work item list.
.. Add another filter or delete an existing filter as required and save the filter with a new name. In the above example, select the *Open Tasks* filter and add the filter *Assignee: _your username_* to see open tasks assigned to you. Save this filter as `My Open Tasks` for future use.
