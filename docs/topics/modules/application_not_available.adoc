= Application not available error

When you click *Rollout to Stage* or *Rollout to Run*, a new browser tab displays your application.

If the new tab displays a *Application is not available* error message (see screen capture), the application is not yet ready.

To fix this issue, wait several minutes and then refresh the page. The application then loads as expected.
