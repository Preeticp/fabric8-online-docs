= Tracking the state of a work item

You can set the state for each of your work items enabling you to track the status of your work item from creation to completion.

By default, a freshly created work item is assigned the *new* state.
You can track and update the status of work items as you progress through your task list as follows:

. Click the *new* drop-down list to see a list of states for the work item. You have the following options: *open*, *in progress*, *resolved* and *closed*.

. Select the appropriate state based on the completion level of your work item. The state for the work item gets updated.

NOTE: By default, closed work items are not listed in the work item list. Select the *Show Completed* check box to see the closed work items.

//TODO: Cases of state will be changed, change screenshot accordingly.
