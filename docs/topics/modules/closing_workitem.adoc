Resolving a Work Item communicates to the team that the task being tracked is complete. Once your task is reviewed and approved you can drag it to the *Closed* state.

You have now created your first quickstart project in {osio}, made changes to your project code, committed the changes to GitHub, and published the new version of your project, and updated the Work Item to reflect your work.
