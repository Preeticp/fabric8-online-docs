= Using your Stack Report

{osio} Analytics helps you make informed choices with respect to your development stack and its dependencies by analyzing your stack at the development stage, within your IDE, and at the deployment stage.

== Development Stage
{osio} provides an integrated development environment in the form of Eclipse link:e2e_workshop.html#creating_che_workspace-hello-world[Che workspaces] to develop your code.
{osio} Analytics flags dependencies with security vulnerabilities by analyzing your stack right at the development stage within  your Che workspace. It also suggests a secure, alternate version of the dependency for your stack.

.Procedure

You can access inputs from {osio} Analytics within the Che IDE as follows:

. In your Che workspace, open the manifest file of your project, for example, `pom.xml` for a Maven Stack, `package.json` for NPM, or `requirements.txt` for Python. {osio} analyzes the stack, flags<Check> (image:che_cve_issue.png[title="CVE Flag"]) dependencies with security vulnerabilities, and suggests an alternate secure version.
. Move the mouse pointer over the icon to see the CVE for the flagged dependency and the suggested alternate version.

+
. Update the dependencies to the suggested version.

== Deployment Stage
When you launch a new quickstart project, a new build/pipeline is executed. At this stage, OpenShift.io analyzes your stack and its dependencies and provides a detailed stack analysis report with insights on alternate and additional dependencies suitable for your stack.

.Prerequisites

Ensure that you deploy your project and <<creating_new_project-user-guide_pipelines,create a pipeline>> for your project.

.Procedure

. Click *Create*, and then *Pipelines* to view the pipeline builds for your project.
. Click btn:[Stack Report] to see the analysis report for your entire stack.<screenshot>

The report displays a summary of four key aspects relevant to your stack in the form of cards:

Security Issues:: This card highlights the number of security issues in your stack, the highest Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score, and the number of dependencies with this high score.
Licenses:: This card suggests an appropriate stack level license, and flags conflicting, unknown, and restrictive licenses affecting your stack. Restrictive licenses are licenses that are not commonly used in similar stack or that do not work well with the stack’s representative license.<Add to glossary>
Insights:: Based on the analysis of other similar stacks, this card identifies usage outliers in your stack and also highlights the number of companion dependencies that could augment your stack.
Dependency Details:: This card lists the number of dependencies analyzed by {osio} and those unknown to it.
. Click each of the cards to see detailed information about the four key aspects of your stack. See <<interpreting_stack_report,interpreting stack report>> for details on each of the aspects covered in the stack report.
. Expand the arrow adjacent to the dependency to see detinformation about:
* the current and latest available version
* licenses, and tags associated with it
* GitHub statistics relevant to it that help assess its popularity
+
These statistics help you compare the existing dependency with the alternate dependency and make a smart choice for your stack.
. To act on the analytics and insights provided by the report:
* In the security issues view, click ‘Report an issue’ to report a security vulnerability highlighted in the report as an issue in the {osio} planner.
* In the insights view, click ‘Create work item’ to create issues for adding the suggested alternate or companion dependency. The issue created in planner is auto populated with the information on the suggested dependency.
