= Using your Stack Report

{osio} Analytics helps you make informed choices with respect to your development stack and its component libraries by analyzing your stack at the development stage, within your IDE, and at the deployment stage.

== Development Stage
{osio} Analytics analyzes your stack at the development stage and flags components with security vulnerabilities in your Che workspace. It also recommends a suitable, secure, alternate version for your stack.

.Prerequisite

Ensure that you use <<e2e/create_che_workspace,Che workspace>> to develop an application.

.Procedure

You can access inputs from {osio} Analytics within the Che IDE as follows:

. In your Che workspace, open the manifest file of your project, for example, `pom.xml` for a Maven Stack, `package.json` for NPM, or `requirements.txt` for Python. {osio} analyzes the stack, flags (image:che_cve_issue.png[title="CVE Flag"]) components with security vulnerabilities, and recommends an alternative secure version.
. Mouse hover the flagged component to see the CVE for the flagged component and the recommended alternative secure version.

+
. Update the component to the recommended version.

== Deployment Stage
At the Deployment stage, {osio} Analytics provides a detailed Stack Analysis Report. It analyzes various parameters of your entire stack and recommends alternative and additional components suitable for your stack.

.Prerequisites

Ensure that you deploy your project and <<creating_a_new_pipeline, create a build pipeline>> for your project.

.Procedure

* In the *Stack Report Recommendations* section of your space dashboard, click *Show complete stack report* to access the detailed stack report for your manifest files.

Alternatively, you can access your stack report as follows:

. Click *Create*, and then *Pipelines* to view the pipeline builds for your project.
. Click *Stack Report* to see the stack and component level analyses for your project.
+
The report displays:

* *Stack Report:* A synopsis of the stack's analysis report

* *Detail analysis of your stack components:* A list of all the stack components and their various parameters, including recommendations of Alternate Components in case of License Outliers or Usage Outliers.

* *Additional components recommended by {osio}:* A list of additional components, commonly used by other similar stacks.
+
See <<interpreting_stack_report, Interpreting your Stack Report>> section for further details.

. Filter the *Detail analysis of your stack components* list to see:

** *<<glossary.adoc#Usage Outliers, Usage Outliers>>* (image:usage_outlier.png[title="Usage Outlier"])
** *<<glossary.adoc#Security Issues, Security Issues>>* (image:security_issues.png[title="Security Issues"])
** *<<glossary.adoc#Alternate Components, Alternate Components>>* (image:alternate_component.png[title="Alternate Components"])
** Grouped Components (image:alternate_component.png[title="Alternate Components"])
** *<<glossary.adoc#License Outliers, License Outliers>>* (image:license _outlier.png[title="License Outliers"])
** *<<glossary.adoc#Unknown Licenses, Unknown Licenses>>* (image:license_unknown.png[title="Unknown Licenses"])
** *<<glossary.adoc#License conflict, License conflict in a Component>>* (image:license_conflicts.png[title="License Conflicts"])
+
Note that, {osio} recommends *Alternate Components* for your stack if it identifies License or Usage outliers.

. In the *Action* column adjacent to the recommended Alternate or Additional components, click *Create Work Item* to create a work item in the {osio} Planner and <<working_with_an_existing_work_item,follow through>> on the recommendations.
