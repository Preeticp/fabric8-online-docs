= Stopping existing workspaces

The OpenShift Online Free Tier supports one running workspace at a time and a workspace created earlier can still be running and result in errors while creating the new workspace. Use the following instructions to ensure that the old workspace is stopped before creating a new workspace for your application:

== Procedure

. In the dashboard of your space, click *Create*.
. In the *Codebases* view, click btn:[Open] next to the workspace of your earlier project. Allow several minutes for the project to load.

A green circle next to the name of the workspace indicates it is running.
... Click the stop icon under *ACTIONS* to stop the running workspace.

Your old workspace resources are now reclaimed in your OpenShift Online account. You can now return to the workspace view in {ct} and create a workspace for your new application.
