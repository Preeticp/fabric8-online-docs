= Selecting a pipeline type

When creating a new application using the quickstart wizard, three types of Jenkins build pipelines are available for your application:

image::select_pipeline.png[Select a pipeline]

* *Build Release, Integration Test, Rollout to Stage, Approve, Rollout to Run* is the recommended option for most applications. It provides an end to end pipeline that moves your application through all the stages of application development, that is, build your source code, test your changes, rollout to the _Stage_ environment, review, manually approve, and promote the changes to the _Run_ environment.

* *Build Release, Integration Test* is the most basic option. After creating the pipeline, this option runs an integration test in the *Test* environment but does not stage the results.

* *Build Release, Integration Test, Rollout to Stage* stages the new version of your application in the *Stage* environment after running integration tests.

== Dashboard deployments view

Depending on which of the three options was selected for your project, the *Deployments* section of the {ct} dashboard displays the version of the project and which stage type each version currently includes.

For example, for the *Release* option, the *Deployments* section of the {ct} dashboard only shows the name of your project because there is no staging required.

For the *Release and Stage* option, the dashboard displays the version and the *Stage* label because the application is staged.

For the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* option, once you promote a version of the project, the dashboard displays both the *Stage* and *Run* environment versions.

== Deployment information

You can use the *Deployments* view to see a detailed view of your application pods in the link:getting-started-guide.html#about_pipelines_stage_run[stage and run] environments, resources consumed in the two environments, and the overall resources used by the application.

At the top of the page, click *Create* and then click *Deployments* to see the deployment details.

This view also displays different types of information depending on the type of pipeline selected for your project as follows:

* For the *Build Release, Integration Test* pipeline, the *Stage* and *Run* details contain no information because this pipeline type does not use these environments.

* For the *Build Release, Integration Test, Rollout to Stage* option, the *Stage* details are available, including resource usage and the version of the project.

* For the *Build Release, Integration Test, Rollout to Stage, Approve, Rollout to Run* pipeline type, the details for both *Stage* and *Run* are listed, along with resource and pod usage. This option is recommended because this gives you the most information and control over your project.
