= Before you begin using {ct}

Before you use {ct}, keep the following information in mind:

* When you sign up to use {ct}, you get an OpenShift Online account with enough resources to run a basic application in the stage and run environments, set pipelines, and develop the codebase in the integrated Eclipse Che workspace.
* Your OpenShift Online Starter account includes two pods and therefore can accommodate two workspaces in {ct}. 
* Ensure that you use {ct} with an OpenShift Online Starter account, not an OpenShift Online Pro account.
