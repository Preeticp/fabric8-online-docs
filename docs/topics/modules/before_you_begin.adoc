= Before you begin using {osio}

Before you use {osio}, keep the following information in mind:

* When you sign up to use OpenShift.io, you get an OpenShift Online account with enough resources to run a basic application in the stage and run environments, set pipelines, and develop the codebase in the integrated Eclipse Che workspace.
* Your OpenShift Online Starter account includes two pods and therefore can accommodate two workspaces in {osio}. To create additional projects, you must reset your {osio} environment using the instructions in <<resetting_your_osio_account>>.
* Ensure that you use {osio} with an OpenShift Online Starter account, not an OpenShift Online Pro account.
