= Approving the build pipeline

Several minutes after starting, your build pipeline is ready to be promoted to *Stage*.

The build pipeline includes steps for a *Stage* build and a *Run* build. *Stage* is a production staging area to review and test your application before finalizing it and deploying the build on *Run*.

To stage your application and review it on *Stage*:

. If you are not on the `Pipelines` view, click btn:[Create] from the options at the top of the screen and then click btn:[Pipelines].
. Click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Stage* in the displayed pipeline. OpenShift Online provides this public URL to access the staged Quickstart application.

+
. In a new browser tab, the HTTP Booster application runs on *Stage*. The Vert.x HTTP Booster Quickstart produces a simple API behind a REST endpoint over HTTP with a minimalist user interface. 
+

NOTE: If the application does not load, see <<application_not_available>> for troubleshooting information.
+
. In the application, enter a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application. The *Result* field displays the JSON result returning
from the API.

If the Quickstart application on the *Stage* build runs as expected, return to the {osio} browser tab and promote your application and build on *Run*:

. Return to the {osio} tab which displays the *Pipeline* view.
. Click btn:[Input Required] at the *Approve* stage of the pipeline.
