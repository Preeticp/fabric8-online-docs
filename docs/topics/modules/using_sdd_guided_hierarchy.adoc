= Using the Scenario Driven Development guided hierarchy

Use the scenario driven guided hierarchy to create work items as follows:

.Prerequisites

* <<creating_new_space-user-guide,Create a space>> using *Scenario Driven Development* as your *Development Process*.

.Procedure
. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the top level work item type group, that is *Scenarios*, for your space.
. Select the *Show Tree* check box to see the work items in a tree view. The tree view allows you to quickly add work items according to the guided hierarchy using the quick-add and the in-line add options.
. Based on the vision statement for the product, use the quick-add option to create high level planning oriented work items, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, select the required high level work item type from the work item type drop-down list. As per the scenario driven development process, you can create *Scenario*, *Fundamental*, or *Papercuts* type of work items, which are tracked under the *Scenarios* work item type group.

.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item, click btn:[Add and open].
. Create child work items for the *Scenarios* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the work item for which you want to add child work items. The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below the work item.
.. From the work item type drop-down list, select the required child work item type. As per the scenario driven hierarchy, you can create *Experience*, or *Value Proposition* type of child work items. These work items are tracked under the *Experiences* work item type group.

.. Add a title to the work item and press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item.
