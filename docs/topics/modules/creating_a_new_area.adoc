= Creating a new area

When you create a new space, {ct} automatically creates a root area with the same name as that of the space. You can create a new child area to group together related work items by type or functionality. Each additional area within the space is created as a child of the root area or another existing child area in the space.

NOTE: As a creator of a space you automatically become an admin for the space. Only a space owner can add areas to the space. Other admins can view the areas, but cannot add new ones.
