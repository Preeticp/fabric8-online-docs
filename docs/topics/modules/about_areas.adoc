= About Areas

*Areas* can organize related <<about_work_items,Work Items>> into groups to distinguish between different types or functionalities that are worked on within a <<about_collaboration_spaces,Collaboration Space>>.

A Space can also include Areas. As an example, your Collaboration Space represents your software project, and each Area tracks components attached to the Space.

Each Area can have child Areas which represent the sub-components for your software project.
