= About areas

_Areas_ can organize related <<about_work_items,work items>> into groups to distinguish between different types or functionalities that are worked on within a <<about_spaces,space>>.

A space can include multiple child areas. As an example, your space represents your project or root area, and each child area represents the sub-components of your project or space.

As a creator of a space you automatically become an admin for the space. Only a space owner can add areas to the space. Other Admins can view the areas, but cannot add new ones.
