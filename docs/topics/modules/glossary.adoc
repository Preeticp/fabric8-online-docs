Rules for this file:

This file is consumed for the automatic generation of infotips used by OSIO web components. Certain rules need to be observed.

* Only use the AsciiDoc syntax for a definition list to define terms.
* Don't capitalize terms arbitrarily.
* Use singulars for term names.
* Each term needs to be bracketed in the following:

  // term: $uuid, en_EN
  // endterm

* When adding a new term, either use the `uuidgen` command on the CLI or use  https://www.uuidgenerator.net/ to generate a new UUID.
* Never change existing UUIDs; even when correcting the name of the term.
* Never remove terms, unless first agreed on with the respective OSIO team that uses its definition.
* Alphabetize the terms for easy orientation.

experience:: An experience is a way to address a scenario, fundamental, or a set of papercuts, each of which often have multiple realizing experiences. Often written as a demonstration script, it describes the ideal end-user work flow for realizing one or more of the associated value propositions.
// endterm

// term: 9ee45d71-1efe-4fec-b1bb-ac92563327a6, en_EN
experiences:: Work item type group that focuses on the experience and value proposition work item types that address the scenarios.
// endterm

// term: dbfc82e1-5a40-44bd-af70-f2dc1a1927a4, en_EN
feature:: Features, often expressed as user stories, are required to actualize parent experiences. They are scoped so that they are generally achievable within a sprint.
// endterm

// term: 4d85adba-817d-41ca-b85f-1e4a938d1282, en_EN
fundamental:: A fundamental describes the basic essentials of a software product, such as quality and performance standards. It is a non-negotiable aspect of a product and its absence reduces the value provided to the user.
// endterm

// term: 5c1b8158-a351-4092-8780-3ad22e1eb173, en_EN
iteration:: A development cycle used to organize, plan, and execute work items in a certain order. It comprises a logical mix of work items slated to be executed within the time frame of the iteration.
// endterm

// term: f05a151a-61fa-45b1-8d8b-b3fd7bc63ea9, en_EN
license conflict:: Licenses that conflict at the stack or dependency level.
// endterm

// term: 83b7cf12-558e-41bd-bcd7-822ca6307db1, en_EN
papercut:: A papercut is a minor issue, often too small to be individually prioritized to be addressed; collectively, papercuts degrade the perception of the product. Grouped together, they receive higher priority and can be tackled together within a development cycle.
// endterm

// term: 5bd840a6-2f62-4bea-bb04-63252f6ce381, en_EN
pipeline:: Pipelines are a continuous delivery system that, at each step, tests and deploys the code to provide feedback to the user. Examples of such steps are unit testing, performance, integration, and deployment. Each step of the pipeline implements different levels of testing and deployment tasks, provides results, and then passes the code on to the next step.
// endterm

// term: 3a953b07-0cc3-4b45-b891-bf490216eae3, en_EN
restrictive license:: Licenses that are not commonly used in similar stacks or that do not work well with the stackâ€™s representative license.
// endterm

// term: a0b10d4f-f639-4978-a2e5-6e858a56f6df, en_EN
requirements:: Work item type group that focuses on execution oriented work item types such as feature, task, and bug.
// endterm

// term: 01e76137-ab89-4a3c-8765-48f54078154a, en_EN
scenario:: A scenario identifies a real-world user problem to resolve. Addressing the scenario provides tangible user value. Prioritize scenarios that deliver maximum user value by evaluating their associated value propositions.
// endterm

// term: 376d7613-4eaf-425e-a2f2-b434205ebdeb, en_EN
scenarios:: Work item type group that focuses on the planning oriented work item types such as scenario, fundamental and papercuts.

// term: eb05f2b6-8a3c-4054-b28c-3eb1a47c125f, en_EN
scenario-driven planning:: A software development methodology focused on real-world problems, or scenarios, described in the language and from the viewpoint of the user. Scenarios deliver particular value propositions and are realized through experiences.
// endterm

// term: a5fad1f2-7d5c-4d62-b269-d3637495422a, en_EN
security issue:: OpenShift.io analyzes the CVEs of all your dependencies and flags the ones with security vulnerabilities.
// endterm

// term: 5c543e22-8ae9-4b66-9112-1513d47ab1b4, en_EN
space:: A space is the equivalent of a project. Each iteration and work item must be attached to a space, and a team of people can be attached to a space in various roles. By default, a space contains at least one area and one iteration.
// endterm

// term: cc2d6cb4-7690-4c02-989c-7d75e3419b7d, en_EN

// term: 83e7953e-9335-428c-b1af-7aa4b00cd662, en_EN
work item:: Work items describe and keep track of work that needs to be completed. They can be assigned to collaborators within a space. Each work item must be attached to a space and an area (assigned by default). This can be used to model bugs, tasks, features, ideas, and more.
// endterm

// term: e4c8beb4-1ed1-4275-af20-9ee3cb6dafd1, en_EN
