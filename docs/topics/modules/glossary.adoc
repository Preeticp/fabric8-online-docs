= Glossary

This glossary provides concise definitions of terms and explanations of concepts used in Red Hat OpenShift.io and in related documentation.

////

Rules for this file:

This file is consumed for the automatic generation of infotips used by OSIO web components. Certain rules need to be observed.

* Only use the AsciiDoc syntax for a definition list to define terms.
* Don't capitalize terms arbitrarily.
* Use singulars for term names.
* Each term needs to be bracketed in the following:

  // term: $uuid, en
  // endterm

* When adding a new term, either use the `uuidgen` command on the CLI or use  https://www.uuidgenerator.net/ to generate a new UUID.
Note: Planner UX provides uuids for each of the terms requiring infotips, use them rather than generating new ones.
* Never change existing UUIDs; even when correcting the name of the term.
* Never remove terms, unless first agreed on with the respective OSIO team that uses its definition.
* Alphabetize the terms for easy orientation.
* After you update the glossary, use $ ./scripts/export_infotips.sh to update the json file.
* Use $ cat json/infotips.json | jq to verify the updated json and then add, commit and push both glossary.adoc and the json file.
