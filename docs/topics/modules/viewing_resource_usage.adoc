= Viewing resource usage

A {ct} account with OpenShift Online provides two pods for your projects. To check your resource consumption in {ct}, navigate to the *Resources* page as follows:

. Click your username in the upper right corner of the {ct} page and select *Settings*.
. In the menu options, click *Resources* to view the resources you have used.
If you have not added any codebases to your {ct} account, the page shows all resources as available. If you add or import a codebase, and have not yet pushed it to the *Run* environment, the page shows that part of the resources for *Stage* are in use.

See <<reviewing_detailed_resource_information-user-guide>> to view further details on resource usage in {oso}.

After you create two projects, the two pods allocated to your {oso} account are used up.

NOTE: Future builds may fail if the required resources are not available. See <<resetting_your_ct_account, resetting your environment>> to reclaim all these resources.
