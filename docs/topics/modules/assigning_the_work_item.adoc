= Assigning the work item

You can assign a work item to any of the collaborators added to your space.

By default, the *Assignees* field for a new work item displays *Unassigned*.

To assign your work item to a collaborator:

. In the *Assignees* field, click *Add Assignee* to see the list of collaborators you can assign the work item to. The list of available collaborators for a space is set by the admin for a space.
. Select the assignees you wish to assign the work item to and click *x* to save the selection.
