= About spaces

_Collaboration spaces_ or _spaces_ are the equivalent of projects. Each <<about_iterations,iteration>> and <<about_work_items,work item>> must be attached to a space, and a team of users can be assigned to a space for the appropriate roles. By default, a space contains one or more <<about_areas,areas>> and iterations.
