= Reducing project memory usage

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
Optimizing memory usage is important when using the Free Tier of OpenShift Online because this tier provides limited memory. Also, each additional project in {osio} requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources.

You can optimize your new quickstart to use less memory as follows:
endif::[]

// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
Your OpenShift Online account must now share resources with two quickstart projects: the Hello World Vert.x project and the new Spring Boot HTTP project.

To optimize memory for the Spring Boot HTTP quickstart:
endif::[]

. In the Che workspace, expand the `src` &#62; `main` &#62; `fabric8` folders for your project.

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]

endif::[]

// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
+

endif::[]

. Right-click the `fabric8` folder and select `New` &#62; `File`.
// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
+

endif::[]

. Name the new file *deployment.yml* and click btn:[OK]. The new file displays in the editor.
// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
+

+

. Copy the contents of the following file to your new YAML file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].
+
IMPORTANT: Spaces are meaningful in YAML files. Ensure that the correct spacing is copied into your YAML file from the link.

. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
