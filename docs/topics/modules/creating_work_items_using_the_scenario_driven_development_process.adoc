= Creating work items using the Scenario Driven Development process

Scenario driven development is an agile development methodology focused on real-world problems, or scenarios, described in the language and from the viewpoint of the user. Scenarios deliver particular value propositions and are realized through experiences.

Use the scenario driven guided hierarchy to create work items as follows:

.Prerequisites

* <<creating_new_space-user-guide,Create a space>> using *Scenario Driven Development* as your *Development Process*.

.Procedure
. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the top level work item type group, that is *Scenarios*, for your space.
+
NOTE: The tree view is the default view of the planner, that is, the *Show Tree* check box is selected by default. The tree view allows you to quickly create work items with parent-child relationship using the quick-add and in-line add options. If you cleared it, ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is selected to see the tree view.
+

. Use the quick-add option to create high level *Scenarios*, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, *Scenario* is the default work item type displayed. Specify an appropriate title for the *Scenario* in the *Work Item Title* field.
+
You can use the work item type drop-down list to create *Fundamental* or *Papercuts* type of work items too under the *Scenarios* work item type group.

+
.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, click btn:[Add and open] to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item.

. Create child *Experiences* for the *Scenarios* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the *+* icon adjacent to the *Scenario* for which you want to add child work items. The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below it.
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, *Experience* is the default work item type displayed. Add an appropriate title to the *Experience*.
.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item.
.. Similarly use the drop-down list to create a child *Value Proposition* for the *Scenario*.

. Use the in-line add option to create an execution oriented child *Feature* for the *Experience*. The scenario driven hierarchy enables you to create *Feature* or *Bug* under the *Requirements* work item type group.
. Use the in-line add option again to further break down the *Feature* into *Task* or *Bug* type of work items.
+

All the execution oriented work item types such as *Feature*, *Task*, and *Bug*  are tracked under the *Requirements* work item type group.
