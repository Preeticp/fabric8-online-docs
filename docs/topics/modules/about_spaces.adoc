= About spaces

A _space_ is the first thing a user creates in {osio}. All other elements are created within a space to organize them for each project. Each codebase, <<about_iterations,Iteration>> and <<about_work_items,Work Item>> are attached to a space, and users are also assigned to a Space for the appropriate roles. By default, a space contains one or more <<about_areas,areas>> and iterations.

As an example, each space can contain multiple codebases, work items tracking work to be done in a project and iterations to track when the work items are to be done.
