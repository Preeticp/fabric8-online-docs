= Creating a new work item

The {ct} planner provides a planning template, based on the agile development process, for managing iterative and incremental software development.

You can create work items using the quick-add or the in-line add options. The in-line add option allows you to create work items with parent-child relations easily.

Use the agile guided hierarchy to create work items of the type, Theme, Epic, Story, Task, Impediment, and Defect, as follows:

. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the *Work Items* for your space.
+
NOTE: The tree view is the default view of the planner, that is, the *Show Tree* check box is selected by default. If you cleared it, ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is selected to see the tree view.
+

. Use the quick-add option to create a high level, planning oriented *Theme*, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, specify an appropriate title for the *Theme* in the *Work Item Title* field.

.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, click btn:[Add and open] to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item.

. You can use the in-line add option to create hierarchical child work items quickly. Create a child *Epic* for the *Theme* using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the *+* icon adjacent to the *Theme* for which you want to add a child *Epic*.

The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below it.

.. Add a title to the *Epic* and press kbd:[Enter] to create it.
. Similarly, use the in-line add option to create an execution oriented child *Story* for the *Epic*, and further break down the *Story* into action oriented, more granular *Task* type of work items.

You can also create child *Impediment* and *Defect* type of work items for the *Theme*, *Epic*, or *Story* type of work items as required.
