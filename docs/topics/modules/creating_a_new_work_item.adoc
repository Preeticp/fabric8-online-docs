= Creating a new work item

The {ct} planner provides a planning template based on the agile development process for managing iterative and incremental software development.

You can create work items using the quick-add or the in-line add options:

* Use the quick-add option to quickly add work items as follows:
. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the *Work Items* for your space.
+
NOTE: The tree view is the default view of the planner. Clear the *Show Tree* check box on the upper-right of the screen to see a flat list of work items.
+

. Use the quick-add option to create a work item as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, use the *Theme* drop-down list to select the type of work item you want to create. You can create a Theme, Epic, Story, Task, Impediment, or Defect.

.. Specify an appropriate title for the work item in the *Work Item Title* field.
