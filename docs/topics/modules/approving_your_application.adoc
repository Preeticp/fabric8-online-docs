= Approving your application

If the quickstart application in the _Stage_ environment runs as expected,  approve your application and promote it to the _Run_ environment:

. Return to the {osio} tab which displays the *Pipeline* view  and click btn:[Input Required] at the *Approve* stage of the pipeline.

. Click btn:[Promote] to promote the build from the _Stage_ environment to the _Run_ environment. The rollout process from _Stage_ to _Run_ requires a few minutes.
