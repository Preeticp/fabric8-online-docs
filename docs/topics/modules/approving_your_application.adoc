= Approving your application

If the quickstart application in the _Stage_ environment runs as expected, approve your application and promote it to the _Run_ environment:

. Return to the {osio} tab which displays the *Pipeline* view and click btn:[Input Required] at the *Approve* stage of the pipeline.

. Click btn:[Promote] to promote the build from the _Stage_ environment to the _Run_ environment. The roll out process from _Stage_ to _Run_ requires a few minutes.

. Optionally, as your build is promoted to _Run_, click *helloworldvertx* or *Build #1* to view the detailed progress of the pipeline or build in your OpenShift Online console, respectively.
. When the *Pipeline* view in {osio} indicates that the project is available in the _Run_ environment, click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Run* to view the application in a new tab.
