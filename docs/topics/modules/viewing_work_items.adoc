= Viewing work items

The list of work items in your space can be viewed in the planner using the _tree view_ or the _flat view_.

== Tree view
The tree view is the default view of the planner. It displays the list of work items along with their parent and child work item links in a hierarchical structure, providing you the context of the work item in relation to the broader project goals.

It ensures your features and tasks have appropriate parent experiences or value propositions associated with them, limiting the chance of feature creep in your development work. This enables you to plan and take up work items focused on delivering actual customer value.

The tree view helps you create appropriate child work items based on the guided work item type planning hierarchy, aiding better planning, prioritizing, and execution.

You can view, track, and plan your work items along with their parent-child links using the tree view as follows:

NOTE: Ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is selected.

. Navigate to Menu:Plan[Backlog]. The *Scenarios* for your space are displayed by default in a tree hierarchy.
. Expand the work items to see the child *Experiences* and *Requirements* type work items associated to them.

== Flat view
The flat list view is useful to track your work items based on their work item type groups. Depending on the selection of the work item type groups in the left pane of the planner, it displays the *Scenarios*, *Experiences*, or *Requirements* for your space.

It does not display the hierarchical parent-child links for the work items and focuses only on the selected work item type group. This helps you plan and draw out your *Scenarios* and *Experiences* or assign your *Requirements* to appropriate *Iterations*<link>.

You can track a particular work item type group using the flat list as follows:

NOTE: Ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is cleared to see the flat view.

. Navigate to Menu:Plan[Backlog]. The *Scenarios* for your space are displayed by default in a tree hierarchy.
. Clear the *Show Tree* check box to see all your *Scenarios* in a flat view.
