= Changing the project code

The example project code includes a new route for *eventbus* and its supporting method. The project sets up *eventbus* to only allow outbound communications for the *my-feed* channel. Messages arriving in the *my-feed* channel are pushed to the browser using the SockJS bridge. This project includes a `vertx-eventbus.js` file along with the `index.html` file and also includes tweaks to the `index.html` file.

Change the code of your project and preview the results as follows:

. In the file directory view, double-click the following directories to expand them: `src` > `main` > `Java`> `io.openshift.booster` > `HttpApplication.java`.
+

+
. Double click the `HttpApplication.java` file to open it and find the following line:
+
[source,java]
----
  protected static final String template = "Aloha, %s!";
----
+
. Add exclamation marks to the string. The line should now be:
+
[source,java]
----
  protected static final String template = "Aloha !!!, %s!";
----
+
. Save the changes (kbd:[Ctrl+s] or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).
+
If you already ran the application earlier as instructed in <<running_your_project_in_the_che_workspace-importing-existing-codebase>>, your changes are instantly implemented. Maven uses the Vert.X hot deploy feature to automatically update the application when you make a change.
+
. Return to the browser tab running the application, type a name in the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.

You have now changed your application code and tested the change.
