= About Iterations

Use _iterations_ to organize <<about_work_items,work items>> to plan and implement tasks for a development project. When used with Scrum, iterations can be utilized to model sprints.

You can use the Planner to map your work items to iterations to plan your work based on your project requirements. It enables you to set time-specific goals by grouping priority work items into a single development cycle. It also helps you track your progress for each iteration and compare it with past iterations and associated work items.
