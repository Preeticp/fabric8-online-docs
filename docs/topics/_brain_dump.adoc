== Summit Use Case

This is the basic use case we are presenting for Summit. The focus here, I think, would be on conceptual information, since the demo would already show the relatively limited functionality of the product at this stage.

== General Concepts

An incomplete list of reference modules:

* Spaces
* Pipelines
* Work Items
* Iterations (not in demo)

== Demo Script Tasks

The demo script is as follows (high-level task view):

. Launch point
. User logs in
.. Register for the demo/create an account
.. Log into an existing account
. Create spaces
.. What are spaces and what do they do in the context of this workflow?
.. How to create new spaces and what options are avaiable, etc.
. Review/Create Work Items (WI)
.. What are WI and what do they do in the context of this workflow?
. Navigate to Che within environment
.. Mmanually? This should be a "Do It" button, but that is not working yet
. Stage build/PR for Jenkins
.. How to stage builds
. Pipeline build (not in demo yet, TBD later when dependencies are ready)
.. What are pipelines and what do they do in the context of this workflow?
.. **Note:** In the demos, we have to select a pipeline when creating a new space, so this may be addressed there first.
. Accepted PR view
.. Fairly simple, viewing accepted PRs and what to do next.
. Show running app
.. Another view. What information is displayed for the running app, etc.?
. Close out work items
.. Another simple one: graceful closing off.

== First Use Use Case

. Register a new user
. Requesting permissions to the space/project

== Space/Project Administrator Use Case

. Get relevant permissions
. Refer to create and change project space
. Controlling the ACLs

== General Developer Use Case

=== Step 1: Working with Spaces

. What are spaces?
. Create a new space
. Add a name for the space
. Select a pipeline
. Select an iteration (optional?)
. Change an existing space
. View pipelines for each space
. Use an existing space

=== Step 2: Working with Pipelines

. What are pipelines?
. Create a new pipeline
. Use an existing pipeline
. Change an existing pipeline
. Configuring pipelines
.. Submitting changes in a pipeline environment
.. Visualizing pipeline progress
.. Reviewing pipeline execution notifications

=== Step 3: Working with Work Items

. What are Work Items
. Create a new Work Item
.. Dialog-based creation (later)
.. Add WI by association (dependency/relationship)
.. Quick add WI
.. Using a definition file (later)
. Changing an existing Work Item
.. Add attachments to WI
.. Change WI state
.. Create/update/delete category types
.. Create/update/delete tag types
.. Set/update iteration for WI
.. Set/remove/update assignee for WI
.. Display/update area field for WI

=== Step 4: The Che Context

. Do It button (not seen yet in demo)
.. Probably just a step, but TBD when we can see it in action

=== Step 5: Reviewing PRs 

. Editing code (enhanced language support to come later)
. Approving PRs (need permissions, tied in with initial space permissions or separate?)
